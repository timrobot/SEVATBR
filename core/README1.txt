You can run the test by doing:

$ make clean
$ make
$ sudo ./core

^ note that this will require sudo permission, and will allow you to test the robot project

you can change the robot_set from TENNIS_BALL_ROBOT to STANDARD_OUT to push the output to standard out instead of the robot

you can also change the input from MNL_SRVR to MNL_CTRL to test an XBOX Controller
