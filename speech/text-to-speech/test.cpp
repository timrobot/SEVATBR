I was designed to find tennis balls and retrieve them back to the designated basket. I am fully autonomous but you can control me with a controller or through the web. My communication capability makes the process easier and you can keep track of everything i do with my logger. To give me commands simply say: fetch to find and pick up balls, stop to have me stop all my current actions. dud dway sir.");
